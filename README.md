8. Post-It is collapsible by clicking the button to the right of the Post-It.
9. Post-It will not go out of bounds of the viewport while collapsed.
    - A collapsed Post-It will be able to reach the bounds (Post-It height will be updated as it resizes)
10. Default Post-It size (200px * 200px) will not go out of bounds of the viewport.
    - Does not support when Post-It resizes due to a high volume of text.

Upcoming:
1. Make Post-It resizable (will likely be predefined options)
2. Add Delete option
3. Add List view? (Might be hard)
